Anaconda is an open-source Python distribution that makes it easy to get up and running with different libraries and packages
and it comes with its own package manager called Conda


// Virtual env using Conda

conda create --name my_app package_name1 package_name2 # atleast one package is required

mac
source activate my_app
windows
activate my_app

mac
source deactivate
windows
deactivate

conda create --name my_app python=2.7 package_name1 package_name2


conda env export > environment.yml


# How to open a yml file on windows?

conda env create -f environment.yml # replicates the env to another project


Two directories in project env directory

Activate directory : will contain scripts that will run when the env is activated
Deactivate directory

Python scope

'''
LEGB
Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in

when wanna use global variable , let's say in a local scope, just write
global x (not recommended to use)

In case of enclosing functions, just use 'nonlocal' to refer to outer function variables
